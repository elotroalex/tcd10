    Collection Data and Caribbean Cultural Heritage
    
  </h2>
  <h3>November 17, 2022 | 1PMâ€“2PM | Location TBD</h3>

  <p>In this two hour workshop, we will examine available options for building digital collections online with small to medium teams. In particular we will do a comparison of Omeka and Wax, and consider the pros and cons. We will also build together a small sample collection using a simple spreadsheet, in order to illustrate the many questions that underlie data curation: epistemology, ontology, taxonomy, data types and more.</p>
